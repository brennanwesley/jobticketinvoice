# JobTicketInvoice Application Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the JobTicketInvoice application to a more structured, maintainable architecture. The goal is to create an enterprise-grade, mobile and desktop functional web application that is easy to maintain and upgrade in the future.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Created shared UI component library in `src/components/ui/`
  - Button.js - Customizable button with variants, sizes, disabled state
  - Input.js - Flexible input component with label, error handling, and React Hook Form support
  - Card.js - Container component with optional header, footer, hover effects
  - Modal.js - Accessible modal dialog with keyboard support
  - Form.js - Form container with standardized layout and error handling
  - VirtualList.js - Virtualized list component for efficient rendering of large datasets
  - LoadingSpinner.js - Reusable loading indicator with size variants
  - index.js - Barrel file for easier imports

- ✅ Created feature-based folder structure
  - `/auth` - Authentication-related components
  - `/tickets` - Ticket-related components and forms
  - `/layout` - Layout and navigation components
  - `/ui` - Shared UI components

- ✅ Migrated components to new structure
  - DraftTicketList.js → tickets/DraftTicketList.js
  - SubmittedTicketList.js → tickets/SubmittedTicketList.js
  - JobTicketFormSelector.js → tickets/JobTicketFormSelector.js
  - DraftTicketView.js → tickets/DraftTicketView.js
  - JobTicketForm.js → tickets/JobTicketForm.js
  - BaseJobTicketForm.js → tickets/forms/BaseJobTicketForm.js
  - PumpTechTicketForm.js → tickets/forms/PumpTechTicketForm.js
  - DriverTicketForm.js → tickets/forms/DriverTicketForm.js
  - Sidebar.js → layout/Sidebar.js
  - LoginForm.js → auth/LoginForm.js (already existed, updated to use UI components)

## Next Steps

### 1. Continue Component Migration

- [x] Move remaining components to appropriate folders:
  - [x] Move `JobTicketForm.js` to `tickets/JobTicketForm.js` ✅
  - [x] Move job ticket forms from `jobTicketForms/` to `tickets/forms/` ✅
  - [ ] Move `Header.js` to `layout/Header.js`
  - [ ] Move profile-related components to `profile/` folder

### 2. Update Import Paths

- [x] Update import paths in ticket-related components ✅
- [x] Use barrel files (index.js) for cleaner imports ✅

### 3. State Management Enhancements

- [x] Create enhanced state persistence utilities with encryption support ✅
  - [x] Implement `statePersistence.js` with AES encryption ✅
  - [x] Add support for both localStorage and sessionStorage ✅
  - [x] Create React hook for reactive persistent state ✅

- [x] Implement API middleware for side effects ✅
  - [x] Add logging for requests/responses ✅
  - [x] Add caching for GET requests ✅
  - [x] Add retry logic with configurable retry count ✅
  - [x] Refactor API service to use middleware ✅

- [x] Split large contexts into smaller focused contexts ✅
  - [x] Create `DraftTicketContext` for draft management ✅
  - [x] Create `TicketFormContext` for form state ✅
  - [x] Create `TicketSubmissionContext` for submission state ✅
  - [x] Create `TicketViewContext` for view state ✅
  - [x] Create combined `TicketProvider` ✅
  - [x] Add backward compatibility layer ✅

### 4. UI/UX Design System Implementation

- [x] Create design system foundation ✅
  - [x] Add design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) ✅
  - [x] Create theme with semantic mappings ✅
  - [x] Add utility functions for styling ✅

- [x] Enhance UI components with design system ✅
  - [x] Refactor Button component ✅
  - [x] Create Skeleton loading components ✅
  - [x] Enhance Form component with progressive disclosure ✅
  - [x] Enhance Input component with inline validation ✅
  - [x] Create FormField, FormSection, and FormGroup components ✅
  - [x] Create example implementation ✅

- [ ] Refactor existing components to use design system
  - [ ] Replace raw HTML elements with UI components in all forms
  - [ ] Standardize form layouts and validation handling
  - [ ] Improve accessibility across all components

### 5. Enhance State Management

- [ ] Refine context providers for better state management
- [ ] Consider implementing React Query for API data fetching
- [ ] Add proper error handling and loading states

### 6. Code Quality Improvements

- **Standardize Error Handling and User Feedback** ✅
  - Create centralized error handling utilities ✅
  - Implement error boundaries for component failures ✅
  - Develop consistent error display components ✅
  - Add global error page for critical failures ✅

- **TypeScript Migration** 🔄
  - Set up TypeScript configuration ✅
  - Create common type definitions ✅
  - Gradually convert JavaScript files to TypeScript 🔄
  - Add type safety to critical components first ✅
  - Created TypeScript versions of error handling components and utilities ✅

- **Documentation** 🔄
  - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all components, functions, and hooks 🔄
  - Create README files for major features ⏳
  - Generate API documentation ⏳

- **Linting and Formatting** ✅
  - Configure ESLint with strict rules ✅
  - Set up Prettier for consistent formatting ✅
  - Add pre-commit hooks to enforce standards ⏳

Progress Notes:
- Error handling infrastructure is complete with centralized utilities, error boundaries, and user-friendly error displays
- TypeScript configuration is set up and common type definitions have been created
- Started migrating key components to TypeScript, beginning with error handling components
- ESLint and Prettier have been configured with appropriate rules for code quality and consistency
- Next steps include continuing TypeScript migration for remaining components, adding comprehensive JSDoc documentation, and setting up pre-commit hooks

### 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Add unit tests for UI components
- [ ] Add integration tests for key user flows

### 6. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement code splitting for better load times
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add proper caching strategies

## Migration Guidelines

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, incremental changes to minimize disruption
2. **Test After Each Change**: Verify functionality after each component migration
3. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure existing features continue to work
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as components are migrated
5. **Consistent Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utilities consistently

## Component Structure Guidelines

Each component should follow these guidelines:

1. Use appropriate imports from feature folders
2. Leverage shared UI components
3. Implement proper prop validation
4. Include JSDoc comments for documentation
5. Follow consistent naming conventions
