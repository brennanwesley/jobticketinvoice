### June 11, 2025 - Vercel Auto-Deployment Test

**Test:** Verifying that frontend changes automatically trigger Vercel deployment when pushed to GitHub.

**Change:** Added this deployment test entry to confirm the CI/CD pipeline is functioning correctly.

**Expected Result:** This change should trigger a new deployment on Vercel within 1-2 minutes of the GitHub push.

### June 9, 2025 - Job Ticket Submission Fix

**Issue:** Job tickets were not being properly submitted and were incorrectly saved as drafts when submission failed.

**Solution:**
1. Fixed schema mismatch between frontend and backend
   - Updated backend to accept both `description` and `workDescription` fields
   - Added proper field validation and mapping

2. Enhanced error handling
   - Improved API error response parsing
   - Added specific error message display in the form
   - Better handling of validation errors

3. Fixed form submission logic
   - Prevented failed submissions from being saved as drafts
   - Only mark tickets as submitted after successful API response
   - Added detailed error feedback for users
